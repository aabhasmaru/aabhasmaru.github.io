This technology will have a big effect on the humans and on the projects, despite forecasts that AI and machine learning will render conventional human enterprises obsolete. Machine learning is anticipated to expand the talent pool for business analyst and its team employment, providing opportunity to data analysts to work for organizations in multiple places

The portraying of AI systems in the media and in popular science fiction films, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has sparked fears that humans may become obsolete as a result of its fast development. After the establishment and management of all technologies, many previously manual tasks will be converted to digital formats. A reasonable concern is that the creation of autonomous computers may be altered once the procedures have been accomplished.

In the past, it was difficult to outsource business analyst work to foreign countries due to language and time zone barriers. In contrast, machine learning could help in providing aid to both and in providing assistance in translating languages, business processes and in data interpretation, as well as 24-hour automation. Online tools for project management and leadership analysis facilitate outsourcing.

Despite the advances achieved in artificial intelligence and machine learning, there are still significant restrictions that must be resolved before they can be applied. It is typical practice for artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to concentrate on a "particular" area of competence, hence limiting their capacity to solve complicated issues and perform a single job. Many of them find it difficult to alter their preprogrammed behavior or to think beyond the box.
