- Created Context diagram, onion map and PUC to define actors and understand where and at what stage they will interact with the platform.

- Based on this created functional and non-functional requirements using [Volere]("www.google.com") requirement method.

- Prioritized the requirements using Volere Prioritization matrix.

- Developed a working prototype using Figma.

- Used Porter's 5 Forces Analysis to analyze the competitive forces within an industry.

- USP: The product will be integrated with open API's of chatgpt, that will allow users to create and customize their own travel plan and based on this they will be directed toward the flights and hotels booking prices.

- For students, along with chatgpt we will integrate the platform with "Student Universe" so that they can avail the best student discounts
